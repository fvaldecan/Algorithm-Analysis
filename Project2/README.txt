-The way that this program works is that you enter a file then it will take the information from that file line by line assuming that it contains Client i's information (start day, end day, revenue). It will turn those clients into an adjacency list, sort them in topological order, and use that order to output:
1. The number of clients in the file.
2. The Optimal Revenue (Most Revenue one can get)
3. The Optimal Path (Clients contributing to the optimal revenue) 

-Extra Credit: Our algorithm uses an adjacency list and queue-base topological sorting
