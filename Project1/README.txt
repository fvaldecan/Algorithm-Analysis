CS415 - Project 1 -Spencer Greco, Nicky Valdecnas

-The way that this program works is you have the option to go into 
"User Testing Mode" or "Scatter Plot Mode". If you go into "Testing Mode" 
you can go into task 1, 2, or 3. If you choose either task 1 or 2 you
are asked to enter (1)n and (2) k. If you chose task 3 then you are asked to enter 
both the M and N. All of these go and do their respected goals outlined in the 
project goals. If you chose from the start to go into "Scatter Plot Mode" then
4 graphs will be plotted all requirements highlighted in the project.

In terms of what works and does not work. As far as we know everything is working.
